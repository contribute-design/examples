# ACME Design Guidelines & Resources

A collection of design contribution guidelines and resources for our ACME product.

> **All participating designers are highly encouraged to shape and evolve these guidelines!**

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

ACME is a product targeted to every single person on earth. Since we manufacture everything on our own our product range is very big and affecting billions of users.

Essentially this section here should give people a blurb about your project, what it does and what the mission of it is.

## ðŸš¢ How to contribute design

1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/myorg/myproject/issues) here on GitHub (we label them with `design: ðŸ’…required`)
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: ðŸ’¡idea` label for it.
3. Clone the public Figma files if available or create new ones and share them publicly
4. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions

**We encourage you to:**

- Get in touch with the team by starting a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/myorg/myproject/discussions) or on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/xxxxxxxxx).
- Check out our [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/myorg/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
  [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/myorg/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## ðŸŽ­ Target audience

Since we are creating a product for everyone we target people from 8 to 99 â€“Â across the board without any specifics. Your project might be different though. So please make sure to describe one or more of your target users as good as possible.
